    "abstract": "This paper presents the first theoretical results showing that stable identification of overcomplete $\\mu$-coherent dictionaries $\\Phi \\in \\R^{d\\times K}$ is locally possible from training signals with sparsity levels $S$ up to the order $O(\\mu^{-2})$ and signal to noise ratios up to $O(\\sqrt{d})$. In particular the dictionary is recoverable as the local maximum of a new maximization criterion that generalizes the K-means criterion. For this maximization criterion results for asymptotic exact recovery for sparsity levels up to $O(\\mu^{-1})$ and stable recovery for sparsity levels up to $O(\\mu^{-2})$ as well as signal to noise ratios up to $O(\\sqrt{d})$ are provided. These asymptotic results translate to finite sample size recovery results with high probability as long as the sample size $N$ scales as $O(K^3dS \\tilde \\epsilon^{-2})$, where the recovery precision $\\tilde{\\epsilon}$ can go down to the asymptotically achievable precision. Further, to actually find the local maxima of the new criterion, a very simple Iterative Thresholding and K (signed) Means algorithm (ITKM), which has complexity $O(dKN)$ in each iteration, is presented and its local efficiency is demonstrated in several experiments.",
