    "abstract": "We derive oracle inequalities for the problems of isotonic and convex regression using the combination of $Q$-aggregation procedure and sparsity pattern aggregation. This improves upon the previous results including the oracle inequalities for the constrained least squares estimator. One of the improvements is that our oracle inequalities are sharp, i.e., with leading constant 1. It allows us to obtain bounds for the minimax regret thus accounting for model misspecification, which was not possible based on the previous results. Another improvement is that we obtain oracle inequalities both with high probability and in expectation.",
